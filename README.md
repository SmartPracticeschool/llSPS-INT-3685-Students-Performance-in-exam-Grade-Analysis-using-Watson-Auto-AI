Student Grade Prediction

This thesis examines the application of machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student will be successful or not. Machine learning techniques can be utilized for studentsâ€™ grades prediction in different courses. Such techniques would help students to improve their performance based on predicted grades and would enable instructors to identify such individuals who might need assistance in the courses. This is best suited for online courses.
